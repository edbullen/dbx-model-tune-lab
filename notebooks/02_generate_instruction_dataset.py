# MAGIC ## Synthetic Data Generation
# MAGIC In this notebook we will use the CoT technique to create high quality questions and answers about Capital Requirements Regulation.
# MAGIC We will iterate over all the chunks we created in the first step and generate a question about the facts mentioned in the chunk and then ask an LLM to answer this question using the provided chunk.
