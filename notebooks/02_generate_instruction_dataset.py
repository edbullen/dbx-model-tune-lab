# MAGIC ## Fine-tuning a European Financial Regulation Assistant model 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Generate synthetic question/answer data about Capital Requirements Regulation and use this data to fine tune the Llama 3.0 8B model.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ## Notebook 2: data generation
# MAGIC
# MAGIC create the tables:
# MAGIC - `qa_dataset`
# MAGIC - `qa_dataset_train`
# MAGIC - `qa_dataset_val`
# MAGIC - `qa_instructions_train` - synthetic training data-set for fine-tuning the LLM
# MAGIC - `qa_instructions_val`  - synthetic validation data-set for testing the LLM

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## Synthetic Data Generation
# MAGIC In this notebook we will use the CoT (Chain of Thought) technique to create high quality questions and answers about Capital Requirements Regulation.
# MAGIC We will iterate over all the chunks we created in the first step and generate a question about the facts mentioned in the chunk and then ask an LLM to answer this question using the provided chunk.  
# MAGIC
# MAGIC This synthetic data will be used by *Notebook 3* to fine-tune an LLM.
